Year Zero Free Tabletop License

Fria Ligan AB (“Free League”) has created the attached Year
Zero Engine System Reference Document (“YZE SRD”).
You may use the YZE SRD to create your own tabletop role
playing game, subject to the terms of this license agreement.
By using the YZE SRD, you agree to these terms.

1. LICENSE. Free League hereby grants you a worldwide,
perpetual, non-exclusive right to copy, use, modify,
translate, and distribute the YZE SRD in printed form, as
a PDF, or as a virtual tabletop module (“VTT”) as part
of your own tabletop role playing game, modules, and
expansions (your “Game”). VTTs do not include NFTs
or video games, only virtual tabletop modules. So long as
you comply with the terms of this agreement, this license
is irrevocable. If you breach the terms of this agreement,
this license terminates automatically.

2. EXCLUSIONS. This agreement applies only to the YZE
SRD. It does not permit you to use any other artwork,
text, or other materials created or owned by Free League
or to use any of Free League’s brands or logos, except as
set forth in section 5, below.

3. OWNERSHIP OF THE YZE SRD. You agree that Free
League owns all rights in the YZE SRD and that you will
not contest those rights. Free League expressly reserves all
rights not expressly granted in this agreement.
4. OWNERSHIP OF YOUR GAME. You own all rights in
any Game you make under this agreement. Free League
may not copy or use your Game without your permission.
But you acknowledge that Free League may independently
create something similar to your Game and that it is not
prohibited from doing so unless it knowingly and inten-
tionally copied your original work.

5. LOGO. You may, but are not required to, place the Year
Zero Engine logo (the “Logo”) on any Game you create
using this license. If you choose to apply the Logo, you
must use the official version made available here and
follow any other guidelines Free League provides for use
of the Logo. Free League reserves the right to require that
you stop using the Logo on a going forward basis at its
sole discretion.

6. NOTICE. You must include a notice on your Game, or
any website or advertising material associated therewith,
that states that your Game is not sponsored or endorsed
by Free League and that you are using the YZE SRD
under license. We recommend, “This game is not affiliated
with, sponsored, or endorsed by Fria Ligan AB. The Year
Zero Engine System Reference Document is used under
Fria Ligan AB’s Free Tabletop License.” You must also
include a copy of or link to this license agreement with
each publication of your game.

7. RESTRICTIONS. Except as expressly permitted in this
agreement, you may not state or imply that Free League
endorses, sponsors, or is affiliated with your Game.
8. REPRESENTATIONS. You represent and warrant that
you have the capacity to enter into this agreement, that
your Game does not violate or infringe the rights of any
third party, and that your Game complies with all appli-
cable laws, rules, and regulations in every jurisdiction in
which it is distributed.

9. DISCLAIMER. FREE LEAGUE IS PROVIDING THE
YZE SRD “AS IS,” MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED
IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND DISCLAIMS ALL WAR-
RANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR
OTHER­ WISE. Free League has no liability for your use
of the YZE SRD and, in addition, you expressly waive
any claim for any indirect, punitive, special, exemplary,
incidental, or consequential damages.

10. MISCELLANEOUS. This is the entire agreement of the
parties relating to the subject matter hereof and you agree
that you have not relied on any terms or representations
other than those expressly stated herein. Free League rec-
ommends that you review this agreement with your own
lawyer and you acknowledge that you have had an oppor-
tunity to do so. Free League may update this agreement at
its sole discretion, but you will continue to have the right
to use the YZE SRD under the terms of this agreement
or any subsequently published version of this agreement
at your sole discretion. No joint venture, partnership,
employment, or agency relationship exists between
you and Free League as a result of this agreement. Free
League’s failure to exercise any right or provision in this
agreement shall not constitute a waiver unless expressly
acknowledged and agreed to by Free League in writing.
