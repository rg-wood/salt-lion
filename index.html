        <h2>Player Characters</h2>

        <p>
          How you create your player character is explained in detail in this
          chapter. The summary below is a helpful overview. Grab a character
          sheet, a pencil, and follow these steps:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Determine your <a href="#attributes">attributes</a>.</li>
          <li>Determine your <a href="#talents">talents</a>.</li>
          <li>
            Determine your <a href="#health">Health</a> and
            <a href="#resolve">Resolve</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Determine your personality traits.</li>
          <li>Pick your gear.</li>
          <li>Choose a name.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Attributes</h3>

        <p>
          Your character has four attributes that indicate your basic physical
          and mental capabilities. Your attributes are used when you are
          <a href="#rolling">rolling</a> to perform actions in the game, and
          also determine how much
          <a href="#damage-and-stress">damage and stress</a> can withstand
          before you become <a href="#broken">broken</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Distribute 14 points across your attributes. You can assign no less
          than 2 and no more than 5 points to any attribute.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>STRENGTH:</strong> Raw muscle power and brawn.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>AGILITY:</strong> Body control, speed, and motor skills.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>WITS:</strong> Sensory perception, intelligence, and sanity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>EMPATHY:</strong> Personal charisma and ability to
            manipulate others.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Talents</h3>

        <p>
          Your talents are the knowledge and abilities you have acquired during
          your life. They are important, as they determine, along with your
          <a href="#attributes">attributes</a>, how effectively you can perform
          certain actions in the game.
        </p>

        <p>
          Talents give you +1 to +3 bonus dice to your
          <a href="#base-dice">base dice pool</a>, depending on their level.
          Some talents may give you other benefits, which are listed in their
          descriptions.
        </p>

        <p>You can distribute 5 points across your starting talents.</p>

        <h4>Defender</h4>

        <p>
          You gain a bonus equal to the level of this talent to defend allies
          within SHORT distance of you.
        </p>

        <h4>Necromancer</h4>

        <p>
          You gain a bonus equal to the level of this talent to speak with the
          undead. Additionally, you can use WITS to sense the presence of the
          undead. Some <a href="#equipment">equipment</a> can give you
          <a href="#gear-dice">Gear Dice</a> that can be added to the roll.
        </p>

        <h3>Health</h3>

        <p>Your starting Health equals your Strength and Agility scores.</p>

        <h3>Resolve</h3>

        <p>Your starting Resolve equals your Wits and Empathy scores.</p>

        <h2>Rolling</h2>

        <p>
          Roleplaying is a conversation. The GM describes the scene, you
          describe how your PCs behave, the GM describes how any NPCs react, you
          reply, and it goes back and forth. But sooner or later, a decisive
          situation will arise, a point of no return, a conflict that
          conversation alone cannot resolve. Then it’s time to break out the
          dice.
        </p>

        <h3>Base Dice</h3>

        <p>
          To roll, grab a number of six-sided dice equal to the most relevant
          attribute. These are your base dice. Then roll all the dice together.
        </p>

        <p>
          SUCCESS: To succeed with your action, you must roll at least one 6. A
          6 is called a success.If you roll several 6s, you get several
          successes.
        </p>

        <p>
          NO TALENT? If you don’t have a relevant talent for the particalar
          action you want to perform, you can roll anyway – simply roll the base
          dice for your attribute alone.
        </p>

        <h4>Gear Dice</h4>

        <p>Useful gear can give you extra dice to roll, called a gear bonus.</p>

        <p>
          For every bane (1) you roll on your base dice from gear when pushing,
          the item’s gear bonus is decreased by one. It simply doesn’t work as
          well anymore. If the gear bonus reaches zero, the item is broken and
          cannot be used. The gear bonus of an item can be reduced by external
          damage as well.
        </p>

        <h3>Modifiers</h3>

        <p>
          Sometimes, external factors help you to succeed. Such modifiers will
          give you additional base dice to roll. Other times, something hampers
          your action. This removes base dice from your pool. You can get such
          modifiers to skill rolls in several different ways: talents, the
          difficulty of the action itself, and help from others.
        </p>

        <p>
          A +1 modifier means you roll one extra base die, +2 means you roll two
          extra base dice, and so on. A −1 modifier means you roll one base die
          fewer than normal, −2 means two fewer, and so on. Several modifiers
          can apply to the same roll, and they are cumulative.
        </p>

        <p>
          Always add and remove base dice from your skills, if you can (not from
          attributes or gear). If you don’t have enough dice from skills, remove
          base dice from gear. If you run out of gear dice as well, remove base
          dice from attributes. If you end up with no dice at all, you have no
          chance to succeed – time to rethink your strategy!
        </p>

        <h3>Complicated Success</h3>

        <p>
          If you only roll one success, you reach your stated goal, but also
          gain some additional complication, depending on the situation and the
          skill used. The GM should make a soft
          <a href="#reactions">reaction</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Failure</h3>

        <p>
          If you roll no success, something goes wrong. For some reason, you
          failed to achieve your goal. A failed roll will have further
          consequences and should move the story forward in a dramatic way.
          Outside of <a href="#combat">combat</a>, the GM should make a hard
          <a href="#reactions">reaction</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          You have one last chance if you really need to succeed – you can push
          the roll.
        </p>

        <h3>Reactions</h3>

        <p>
          Whenever everyone looks to you to see what happens or the rules say,
          choose a reaction.
        </p>

        <p>
          A <strong>soft reaction</strong> is one without immediate, irrevocable
          consequences. That usually means it’s something not all that bad, like
          revealing that there’s more treasure if they can just find a way past
          the golem (offer an opportunity with cost). It can also mean that it’s
          something bad, but they have time to avoid it, like hearing an
          approaching band of goblin archers with a chance to hide from them.
        </p>

        <p>
          A soft reaction ignored becomes a golden opportunity for a hard
          reaction.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Hard reactions</strong>, on the other hand, have immediate
          consequences.
        </p>

        <p>Possible reactions include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Reveal an unwelcome truth</li>
          <li>Show signs of an approaching threat</li>
          <li>Use up resources</li>
          <li>Turn their action back on them</li>
          <li>Separate them</li>
          <li>Offer an opportunity</li>
          <li>Put someone on the spot</li>
          <li>Give them a hard choice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pushing</h3>

        <p>
          If you fail your initial roll, or if you want additional successes,
          you can lean into the action, giving it everything you’ve got, pushing
          yourself to the limit. This is called a <strong>push</strong>, and
          lets you re-roll any dice that don’t show the result of 1.
        </p>

        <p>
          How a pushed roll plays out in story terms depends on what skill you
          are using. It can take the form of a great physical exertion, total
          mental focus, or emotional strain.
        </p>

        <h4>Banes</h4>

        <p>
          A base die showing a 1 is called a bane and can never be re-rolled
          when pushing. After a push, you cannot change back to the previous
          result. All dice count after the push, even any dice you didn’t
          re-roll.
        </p>

        <h3>Help</h3>

        <h3>Opposed Rolls</h3>

        <h2>Combat</h2>

        <h3>Damage & Stress</h3>

        <p>
          Damage and stress to characters can reduce your
          <a href="#health">Health</a> and <a href="#resolve">Resolve</a> scores
          and cause <a href="#critical-injuries"> critical injuries</a>.
        </p>

        <p>You can suffer damage in many ways. These are the most common:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            PUSHING: <a href="#pushing">Pushing</a> can inflict damage and
            stress. Armor has no effect against damage from pushing.
          </li>

          <li>
            ATTACKS: Whenever you <a href="#attacks">attack</a> someone in
            <a href="#combat">combat</a>, you inflict damage equal to the base
            damage rating of the weapon, plus one additional point of damage for
            each extra success rolled beyond the first. The same goes for damage
            from explosions, fire, etc.
          </li>

          <li>
            STRESSFUL SITUATIONS: When your PC is subjected to fear or a
            stressful situation, the GM determines the potential stress
            inflicted (see the table below). You then make an Empathy roll (not
            an action) – each success rolled eliminates one point of potential
            stress. You can push the roll, but at the risk of suffering even
            more stress if you get any on the re-roll.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <table id="stressful-situations">

        <h4>Broken</h4>

        <p>
          Your PC can be broken by
          <a href="#damage-and-stress">damage or stress</a>. You are broken if
          <a href="#health">Health</a> or <a href="#resolve">Resolve</a>
          are reduced to zero. basically means you are taken out of action, and
          you might risk even lethal injuries. When broken, you can’t perform
          any actions or make rolls.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can’t go below zero in <a href="#health">Health</a> or
          <a href="#resolve">Resolve</a>. If you suffer further damage, you may
          suffer an additional
          <a href="#critical-injuries">critical injury</a> however.
        </p>

        <h3>Critical Injuries</h3>

        <p>
          Critical injuries are dangerous, even lethal, injuries to your body or
          mind. You suffer a physical critical injury when your
          <a href="#health">Health</a> is reduced to zero, and a mental critical
          injury when your <a href="#resolve">Resolve</a> is reduced to zero.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you suffer a critical injury, roll on the relevant table below to
          see what it is.
