        <h1>Salt Lion</h1>
<p><strong>Salt Lion</strong> is a hack of the Year Zero Engine for fantasy roleplaying, focussing on simplicity while building on top of the original fast, accessible and story-driven system. The rules have been simplified, inspired by the new system flavour used in <em>Coriolis - The Great Dark</em>.</p>
<h2>Player Characters</h2>
<p>How you create your player character is explained in detail in this
chapter. The summary below is a helpful overview. Grab a character
sheet, a pencil, and follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose your <a href="#class">class</a>.</li>
<li>Determine your <a href="#attributes">attributes</a>.</li>
<li>Determine your <a href="#talents">talents</a>.</li>
<li>Determine your <a href="#health">Health</a> and <a href="#resolve">Resolve</a>.</li>
<li>Determine your <a href="#personality-traits">personality traits</a>.</li>
<li>Pick your <a href="#gear">gear</a>.</li>
<li>Choose a name.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
<p>Your character has four attributes that indicate your basic physical and
mental capabilities. Your attributes are used when you are
<a href="#rolling">rolling</a> to perform actions in the game, and also determine
how much <a href="#damage-and-stress">damage and stress</a> can withstand before
you become <a href="#broken">broken</a>.</p>
<p>Distribute 14 points across your attributes. You can assign no less than
2 and no more than 4 points to any attribute.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>STRENGTH:</strong> Raw muscle power and brawn.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>AGILITY:</strong> Body control, speed, and motor skills.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>WITS:</strong> Sensory perception, intelligence, and sanity.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>EMPATHY:</strong> Personal charisma and ability to manipulate others.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Determine Talents</h3>
<p>Your <a href="#talents">talents</a> are the knowledge and abilities you have acquired during
your life. They are important, as they determine, along with your
<a href="#attributes">attributes</a>, how effectively you can perform certain
actions in the game.</p>
<p>Talents give you +1 to +3 bonus dice to your <a href="#base-dice">base dice
pool</a>, depending on their level. Some talents may give you
other benefits, which are listed in their descriptions.</p>
<p>You start with any two <a href="#general-talents">general talents</a> and any three talents from your <a href="#class">class</a>. Each talent starts at level 1. If you choose the same talent twice, it starts at level 2.</p>
<h3>Health</h3>
<p>Your starting Health equals your Strength and Agility scores. See <a href="#damage-and-stress">Damage and Stress</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Resolve</h3>
<p>Your starting Resolve equals your Wits and Empathy scores. See <a href="#damage-and-stress">Damage and Stress</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Personality Traits</h3>
<p>Personality Traits give your PC unique qualities beyond the numerical stats. Pick a pride and a weakness during character creation.</p>
<h4>Pride</h4>
<p>Something specific that defines your character and makes them stand out. It can be an ability, an event in your past, or something else. Once per game session, you may check your Pride to get one automatic success in a dice roll. You must justify how your Pride helps you.</p>
<h4>Weakness</h4>
<p>An Achilles heel that can get you into trouble somehow. Your weakness adds depth and personality to your character and can also be used by the GM to create challenges for you. Roleplaying according to your weakness gives you extra XP at the end of the session.</p>
<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>The things you learn during the game are measured in Experience Points (XP). You receive XP after the end of each game session. Talk it through and let the whole group discuss what has happened. For each of the below questions that you can reply “yes” to, you get one XP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you participate in the game session?</li>
<li>Did you explore a new location?</li>
<li>Did you defeat one or more dangerous adversaries?</li>
<li>Did you overcome an obstacle without using force?</li>
<li>Did you act according to your <a href="#weakness">weakness</a>?</li>
<li>Did you perform another extraordinary action of some kind?</li>
</ul>
<p>The GM has the final word when it comes to how much XP each character should get.</p>
<p>You can use your XP to improve your <a href="#talents">talents</a>, or to learn new ones. You can only spend XP when your PC gets a chance to rest, or between game sessions.</p>
<p>To increase a talent level by one step costs a number of XP indicated by the table below. You can only increase a talent level one step at a time. Learning a new talent costs 5 XP.</p>

<h2>Rolling</h2>
<p>Roleplaying is a conversation. The GM describes the scene, you describe
how your PCs behave, the GM describes how any NPCs react, you reply, and
it goes back and forth. But sooner or later, a decisive situation will
arise, a point of no return, a conflict that conversation alone cannot
resolve. Then it&#39;s time to break out the dice.</p>
<p>As a rule, you only have one chance to succeed with any action. Once you have rolled the dice – and pushed the roll – you may not roll again to achieve the same goal. You need to try something different or wait until the circumstances have changed in a substantial way. Or let another player character try. This rule does not apply to combat, where you can attack the same enemy multiple times.</p>
<h3>Base Dice</h3>
<p>To roll, grab a number of six-sided dice equal to the most relevant
attribute. These are your base dice. Then roll all the dice together.</p>
<p>SUCCESS: To succeed with your action, you must roll at least one 6. A 6
is called a success.If you roll several 6s, you get several successes.</p>
<p>NO TALENT? If you don&#39;t have a relevant talent for the particular action
you want to perform, you can roll anyway -- simply roll the base dice
for your attribute alone.</p>
<h3>Gear Dice</h3>
<p>Useful <a href="#gear">gear</a> can give you extra dice to roll, called a gear bonus.</p>
<p>For every bane (1) you roll on your base dice from gear when pushing,
the item&#39;s gear bonus is decreased by one. It simply doesn&#39;t work as
well any more. If the gear bonus reaches zero, the item is broken and
cannot be used. The gear bonus of an item can be reduced by external
damage as well.</p>
<h3>Modifiers</h3>
<p>Sometimes, external factors help you to succeed. Such modifiers will
give you additional <a href="#base-dice">base dice</a> to <a href="#rolling">roll</a>. Other times, something hampers
your action. This removes base dice from your pool. You can get such
modifiers to skill rolls in several different ways: talents, the
difficulty of the action itself, and help from others.</p>
<p>A +1 modifier means you roll one extra base die, +2 means you roll two
extra base dice, and so on. A −1 modifier means you roll one base die
fewer than normal, −2 means two fewer, and so on. Several modifiers can
apply to the same roll, and they are cumulative.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t have enough base dice, remove
<a href="#gear-dice">gear dice</a>. If you end up with no dice at all, you have no
chance to succeed -- time to rethink your strategy!</p>
<h3>Difficulty</h3>
<p>Normally, the GM doesn’t assess how difficult an action is. You only roll dice in challenging situations – period. But sometimes, the GM might want to underscore that external factors either help or hinder an action. Use the difficulty table for guidance.</p>

</tbody></table>
<h3>Complicated Success</h3>
<p>If you only roll one success, you reach your stated goal, but also gain
some additional complication, depending on the situation and the skill
used. The GM should make a soft <a href="#move">move</a>.</p>
<h3>Failure</h3>
<p>If you roll no success, something goes wrong. For some reason, you
failed to achieve your goal. A failed roll will have further
consequences and should move the story forward in a dramatic way.
Outside of <a href="#combat">combat</a>, the GM should make a hard
<a href="#moves">move</a>.</p>
<p>You have one last chance if you really need to succeed -- you can push
the roll.</p>
<h3>Moves</h3>
<p>Whenever everyone looks to the GM to see what happens or the rules say, they choose a move.</p>
<p>A <strong>soft move</strong> is one without immediate, irrevocable consequences.
That usually means it&#39;s something not all that bad, like revealing that
there&#39;s more treasure if they can just find a way past the golem (offer
an opportunity with cost). It can also mean that it&#39;s something bad, but
they have time to avoid it, like hearing an approaching band of goblin
archers with a chance to hide from them.</p>
<p>A soft move ignored becomes a golden opportunity for a hard
move.</p>
<p><strong>Hard moves</strong>, on the other hand, have immediate consequences.</p>
<p>Possible moves include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reveal an unwelcome truth</li>
<li>Show signs of an approaching threat</li>
<li>Use up resources</li>
<li>Turn their action back on them</li>
<li>Separate them</li>
<li>Offer an opportunity</li>
<li>Put someone on the spot</li>
<li>Give them a hard choice</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pushing</h3>
<p>If you fail your initial roll, or if you want additional successes, you
can lean into the action, giving it everything you&#39;ve got, pushing
yourself to the limit. This is called a <strong>push</strong>, and lets you re-roll
any dice that don&#39;t show the result of 1.</p>
<p>How a pushed roll plays out in story terms depends on what skill you are
using. It can take the form of a great physical exertion, total mental
focus, or emotional strain.</p>
<p>You can only push a skill roll once. If you don’t succeed on your second try, you are stuck dealing with the consequences.</p>
<p>You can only push skill rolls when you actively perform an action.</p>
<h3>Banes</h3>
<p>A base die showing a 1 is called a bane and can never be re-rolled when
pushing. After a push, you cannot change back to the previous result.
All dice count after the push, even any dice you didn&#39;t re-roll.</p>
<p>Normally, each bane deals 1 point of damage to <a href="#health">Health</a> or <a href="#resolve">Resolve</a>. Rolling a bane on an action involving Empathy or Wits deals damage to Resolve, and Health for Strength or Agility.</p>
<h3>Help</h3>
<p>Other PCs or NPCs can help you succeed at a skill roll. This must be declared before you roll your dice. It must also make sense in the story – the individuals helping you must be physically present and have the capacity to support your action. The GM has final say.</p>
<p>For each person helping you, you get a +1 modifier. No more than three people can help you with a single roll, meaning your maximum modifier from getting help is +3. In combat, helping counts as the same type of action as the one you are supporting (fast or slow).</p>
<p>NPCs can help each other in the same way as player characters. Letting NPCs act in groups instead of individually is often an easy way to manage large numbers of NPCs in combat.</p>
<h3>Opposed Rolls</h3>
<p>Sometimes, rolling a success isn’t enough to succeed with your skill roll. In some cases, you must beat your opponent in an opposed roll. To win an opposed roll, you must roll more successes than your adversary. Every success rolled by your adversary eliminates one of your successes. Only you (the active party) can push your roll – and you can decide to do so even after your opponent rolls.</p>
<h3>Aggravated Rolls</h3>
<p>Sometimes actions are more than just difficult: they require willpower to push them over the line and succeed. These are frustrated rolls. With an aggravated roll all <a href="#banes">banes</a> are active on the first roll, as though you had <a href="#pushing">pushed</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can incur <a href="#critical-injuries">critical injuries</a> when you&#39;re <a href="#broken">broken</a> by an aggravated roll. You can still push aggravated rolls.</p>
<p>The rules will tell you when a roll is aggravated. Typically when you&#39;re using <a href="#magic-talents">magic talents</a>.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Combat is deadly in <strong>Salt Lion</strong>. Before you enter a fight, you should always ask yourself: Is it worth it?</p>
<h3>Zones</h3>
<p>A violent conflict is typically played out using a map of the location where your characters happen to find themselves fighting for their lives.</p>
<p>The map is divided into zones. A zone is typically a room, a corridor, or an area of ground. How big a zone is varies – from a few steps across up to about 25 meters. A zone is generally smaller in a cramped environment than in open terrain.</p>
<h3>Ranges</h3>
<p>The distance between you and your opponents is divided into five range categories:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>RANGE</th>
<th>DESCRIPTION</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Engaged</td>
<td>Right next to you</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Short</td>
<td>A few meters away, in the same zone as you</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Medium</td>
<td>Up to 25 meters away, in an adjacent zone</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Long</td>
<td>Up to about one hundred meters (four zones) away</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Extreme</td>
<td>Up to about one kilometre</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3>Initiative</h3>
<p>When combat begins, the first step is to determine who has the initiative. Do this before anyone rolls dice for an action. Each player taking part in the conflict, either voluntarily or involuntarily, rolls Agility + 2d6. Participants act in order from highest to lowest number, until everyone has taken their turn. If characters draw, the one with the highest Agility goes first, or the GM randomly chooses the fastest character.</p>
<h4>NPC Initiative</h4>
<p>For a group of NPCs with identical stats, the GM can, if they want, draw one initiative card for the group instead of one per individual. All the NPCs in that group act at the same point in the round order. In what order they act individually within the group is up to the GM.</p>
<h4>Rounds</h4>
<p>When all the participants in the combat have acted once, the round is over, and a new round begins. The round order remains the same throughout the whole conflict – drawing initiative is only done once, at the start of the first round.</p>
<h4>Turns</h4>
<p>The point in the initiative order at which you act is called your turn. On your turn, you can perform one slow action and one fast action, or two fast actions.</p>
<h4>Reactions</h4>
<p>Some actions can happen outside your turn in reaction to another character&#39;s action, such as blocking or dodging. These are called reactions, and are treated like other combat actions. If you are rolling, you must declare that you are attempting a reaction before the other characters rolls for theirs.</p>

<h3>Body Armour</h3>
<p>Body armour can protect you from damage. Armour doesn’t
provide protection from other kinds of damage, or from damage you inflict on yourself when you push a roll. The effect of
armour is determined by its <a href="#gear-dice">gear dice</a>.</p>
<p>When you suffer damage from a physical attack, roll the gear dice. Every success you roll decreases the damage by one. This roll does not count as an action and cannot be pushed.</p>
<p>If any damage penetrates your armour,
it is damaged – every bane you rolled reduces
the armour rating by one step. If the armour absorbs all the damage, any banes rolled have no effect.</p>
<p>Armour can be repaired.</p>
<h3>Damage and Stress</h3>
<p>Damage and stress to characters can reduce your <a href="#health">Health</a> and
<a href="#resolve">Resolve</a> scores and cause <a href="#critical-injuries">critical
injuries</a>.</p>
<p>You can suffer damage in many ways. These are the most common:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>PUSHING: <a href="#pushing">Pushing</a> can inflict damage and stress. Armour has
no effect against damage from pushing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>ATTACKS: Whenever you <a href="#attacks">attack</a> someone in <a href="#combat">combat</a>,
you inflict damage equal to the base damage rating of the weapon, plus
one additional point of damage for each extra success rolled beyond
the first. The same goes for damage from explosions, fire, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>STRESSFUL SITUATIONS: When your PC is subjected to fear or a stressful
situation, the GM determines the potential stress inflicted (see the
table below). You then make an Empathy roll (not an action) -- each
success rolled eliminates one point of potential stress. You can push
the roll, but at the risk of suffering even more stress if you get any
on the re-roll.</p>

<h3>Broken</h3>
<p>Your PC can be broken by <a href="#damage-and-stress">damage or stress</a>. You are broken if <a href="#health">Health</a> or <a href="#resolve">Resolve</a> are reduced to zero. This basically means you are taken out of action, and you might risk even lethal injuries. When broken, you can&#39;t perform any actions or make rolls.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t go below zero in <a href="#health">Health</a> or <a href="#resolve">Resolve</a>. If you suffer further damage, you may suffer an additional <a href="#critical-injuries">critical injury</a> however.</p>
<h3>Recovery</h3>
<p>Being broken is not fatal in itself – only <a href="#critical-injuries">critical injuries</a> can actually kill you. There are two ways to recover after being broken, assuming you’re not dead.</p>
<ul>
<li>GETTING HELP: Someone can help you recover by using EMPATHY. This is a slow action. If the roll is successful, you immediately heal damage or stress equal to the number of successes rolled. Getting help only has this effect on a broken victim.</li>
<li>ON YOUR OWN: If no one is around to help you, you automatically heal one point of damage or stress after one quarter day has passed.</li>
<li>NOT BROKEN? If you are not broken, you heal one point of <a href="#health">Health</a> or <a href="#resolve">Resolve</a> per quarter day. You can heal damage and stress at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Critical Injuries</h3>
<p>Critical injuries are dangerous, even lethal, injuries to your body or
mind. You suffer a <a href="#physical-injuries">physical critical injury</a> when your <a href="#health">Health</a>
is reduced to zero, and a <a href="#mental-injuries">mental critical injury</a> when your
<a href="#resolve">Resolve</a> is reduced to zero.</p>
<p>You cannot gain critical injuries when you&#39;re broken by <a href="#pushing">pushing a roll</a>.</p>
<p>Critical injuries are as much mechanical as they are narrative, and should be roleplayed.</p>
<p>When you suffer a critical injury, roll on the relevant table below to
see what it is.</p>
<h4>Recovering from Injuries</h4>
<p>Each critical injury has a specific effect that you suffer for a number of days equal to the first roll (i.e. 5 days if you roll 54 on a D66). If you have several crits, they will heal simultaneously. If an injury is listed as permanent, it will never heal.</p>
<p>MODIFIERS: Modifiers due to critical injuries are cumulative.</p>
<p>CARE: If someone tends to you for a quarter day during the process of healing a critical injury and makes a EMPATHY roll, that day counts double.</p>
<p>DAMAGE: Note that you can heal all of your <a href="#damage-and-stress">damage or stress</a>, but still suffer the effects of a critical injury.</p>

<h3>Design Notes</h3>
<p>This section describes the various choices and deviations I made writing <strong>Salt Lion</strong>, based on material from the original <a href="https://freeleaguepublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/YZE-Standard-Reference-Document.pdf">Year Zero Engine SRD</a>.</p>
<p>This document is designed to be open and modifiable, and this section may be of use to those making their own hacks.</p>
<h4>Simplifications</h4>
<p><strong>Salt Lion</strong> is a paired down version of the Year Zero Engine, modified with simplicity in mind. In particular, it only uses D6s, and willpower points and skills have been removed.</p>
<p>Other simplifications include:</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not track encumbrance</li>
<li><a href="#health">Health</a> and <a href="#resolve">Resolve</a> are the totals of two attributes, rather than their average. This means they are double the values expected from the Year Zero SRD, so damages are roughly doubled as well.</li>
<li><a href="#critical-injuries">Critical injuries</a> follow the rules for conditions.</li>
<li>The complicated descriptions of various combat actions have been removed, instead relying on GM rulings and common sense. For example, it&#39;s obvious a grapple action should be an opposed roll of STRENGTH vs STRENGTH/AGILITY.</li>
</ul>
<h4>New Mechanics</h4>
<p>Some new mechanics have been added, although I&#39;ve tried to keep these to a minimum.</p>
<p>The most notable addition to the Year Zero Engine are <a href="#aggravated-rolls">aggravated rolls</a>, which have been added as a way of eliminating the need for willpower points.</p>
<p>Also, GM <a href="#moves">moves</a> has been imported from <em>Dungeon World</em>.</p>
